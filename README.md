# Plant-detection-ML
Detecting 11 species of wild plants, each one had 400 images. 
Testing different operations on images for distinguishing then saving all the images in dataframe. 
Using different ML classifiers with the saved dataframe to get the best classifier, which could distinguish the different species from each other. 
Two files have been created, the first one save_data_all for testing the different operation on images and save them in dataframe.
The second file ML_models, for applying the different classifiers on the data.
